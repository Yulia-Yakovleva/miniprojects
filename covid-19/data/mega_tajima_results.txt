NOTE.-- This analysis involved 1111 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 29088 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [2][3] 

Abbreviations: m = number of sequences, n = total number of sites, S = Number of segregating sites, ps = S/n, Θ = ps/a1, π = nucleotide diversity, and D is the Tajima test statistic (see chapter 12 in ref. [4] for details).
